    question: "How long does a typical welding project take?",
    answer: "Project timelines vary based on complexity and scope. Simple repairs might be completed in a day, while custom gates typically take 2-3 weeks. Structural projects may require 4-6 weeks. We'll provide a detailed timeline during your free consultation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a permit for my project?",
    answer: "Permit requirements depend on the project type and location. Many structural projects and large gates require permits. Don't worry — we handle all permit applications and inspections as part of our full-service approach.",
  },
  {
    question: "What areas do you serve?",
    answer: "We serve the greater Orlando area — from Ocala in the north, down to St. Cloud in the south, east to the Cocoa Beach area, and west to Clearwater and Tampa. These reference points give you a sense of our coverage, though exact service boundaries may vary by project.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work from my design or drawings?",
    answer: "Yes! We can work from your sketches, blueprints, or existing designs. We also offer design consultation services if you need help bringing your vision to life. Our team can create detailed CAD drawings for approval before fabrication begins.",
